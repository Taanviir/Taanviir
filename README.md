### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name's Tanvir, a software developer with interests in web dev and game dev!

I am skilled in multiple languages of different paradigms and have knowledge of system administration through my continued learning at school 42.
Through my dedicated time at school 42 I've learned to take on challenging projects and learning things from scratch by myself.

Do feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you're interested in learning more about my projects or even collaborating!
